# America Has a Problem, and It’s You
---

I suspect I feel an unusually high level of empathy for others. I’m still uncomfortable saying that to myself, and if you’ve known me for a long time, you probably know why. (It’s because I used to act like a dick.)

Before we dive in, let’s get on the same page. The definition of empathy varies depending on context, and there’s not a strong scientific consensus on some of the following, but generally speaking, there are two “types” of empathy, which probably overlap but are not exactly the same. There’s emotional or affective empathy, which is the way you *feel* for a friend who has just lost a loved one, or for a child who fell and scraped their hand, or for a guy who just got down on one knee, and… she said yes! It’s an other-oriented combination of emotions, frequently involving sympathy or compassion, but it’s not limited to negative states. And then there’s cognitive empathy, which is your mind’s ability to take on the perspective of others, to “put yourself in their shoes.” At its most basic level, it’s what you do when you’re sitting across from someone and know to say “Look over to your left” even though it’s to *your* right. But it also includes saying sorry after accidentally cutting someone off — because you know what it’s like when someone cuts you off — or, more difficult,  imagining what it would be like to be in a situation you haven’t (say, experiencing pregnancy, if you’re male).

I’ve been asked whether I believe adults can learn empathy. I do. Children aren’t born with empathy; my understanding is it usually starts to kick in around 2 years old or so. Before this development, the primary way kids respond to intense emotions in others is with distress. Whereas affective empathy is a congruent response between the observer and self, distress doesn’t have to be. Thus strong or confusing emotional displays make infants cry. There are a number of disorders which are hypothesized to inhibit either affective or cognitive empathy, including autism, psychopathy, narcissism, ADHD, and so on. But assuming your brain isn’t physically incapable of developing empathic circuitry (whatever that means), I think of empathy like I do any other mental process: reinforced through practice. It may be easier to pick up as a child, but if one can’t learn to feel greater empathy as an adult, I’m not sure how else to explain the changes I’ve experienced over the past 10 years.

By relating to people better and mirroring their emotional state, you can form stronger relationships, not take things so personally, and just feel more connected to other humans. Cool, right? But since I care about you, I’m going to be honest: it’s going to hurt. If you open up to feeling more of people’s emotions and understanding more of their perspective, you’ll quickly realize a lot of what we feel and think, well, it doesn’t feel good. It hurts. As I said before, empathy isn’t limited to negative emotions, so you’ll feel and understand more joy too. But it turns out there’s a lot of suffering in the world, and developing greater empathy can at times feel like turning up the volume on that suffering.

But here’s where it gets weirder. As I became aware I feel more empathy than the average person, I became *painfully* aware of it. (More pain, woo! I’m really selling this empathy thing, huh?) Because most people don’t feel all that much on behalf of others. Notice the “on behalf of” others. That’s the key to empathy: a congruence between what they’re feeling/thinking, and how you’re feeling/thinking about them. But we *do* feel things toward people we don’t empathize with. Just not compassionate things. As social creatures, other people incite emotions in us constantly. But in the absence of empathy, we often assign a certain weight to these feelings: “I would never do that. They must be a [negative adjective] person.” This is part of an ultra-rapid feedback loop. As soon as a person’s actions seem alien or hostile us, the empathetic parts of our mind — both affective and cognitive — grow quiet and the threat-response parts of our mind kick in.

Noticing someone’s mental state shift into this mode hurts. (Can you feel my pain yet?) From a detached point of view, this doesn’t really make sense. Why does an unempathetic response toward a third party, whom I often don’t know and might even actively dislike, cause me pain? I think there are a few reasons:
- From a Buddhist perspective, actions following from a lack of empathy are “unskillful.” Callous indifference or malice adds more suffering to the world unnecessarily. As I 1) become aware my responses to situations are causing others to suffer, 2) desire to alleviate that suffering, and 3) work to break those habits, I feel frustrated when I see someone continue to pour fuel on the fire.
- In a more “woo-woo” sense, we’re, like, all connected, man. Don’t worry, we don’t have to get metaphysical about it. In a purely materialist karmic sense — that’s not an oxymoron, bear with me — the actions you take influence your future. “Karma” literally means “an action” in Sanskrit. A harsh action you take, resulting from missing empathy, effectively adds a +1 to your internal harshness score. Over time, this begets more harshness in your life. In other words, this hurts to witness because it’s like watching you [piss in your own gouged out eye](https://youtu.be/Qk-BMpQNvZU). I feel empathy for the pain your *lack* of empathy is causing you, even if you’re not aware of it. (Is it still empathy if you’re feeling something on behalf of someone who doesn’t know they’re feeling it?)
- People want to be understood. Life is hard for all of us, but we’re all different, and it’s difficult, if not impossible, to communicate your inner experience. Possibly because of its scarcity, to feel truly seen by another is one of life’s most fulfilling experiences. Closing yourself off to understanding someone just a little bit better feels like a missed opportunity to give them an incredible gift.

Some people are easier to empathize with than others. Or maybe it’s better to say it’s easy to close yourself off to feeling empathy toward certain people. As I continue to grow my sphere of empathy and reach more people, my sphere includes more of the contemptible, the deplorable, the sinners, rejected and unreachable by most of the world. Naturally, there aren’t a lot of other people’s spheres of empathy out there. Recognizing this distance from the warmth of compassion brings with it a lonely kind of sorrow, and the sorrow grows with the distance. In a sense, these people need our empathy the most, if they’re ever to be reached and reclaimed, but we think they “deserve” it the least, making their trajectory more likely to be permanent.

But enough about me for a moment. I said America has a problem, so let’s talk about that. The problem is that a lot of you *think* you’re good at empathizing, but you’re not. From what I witness, what you might call empathy is instead an automatic protective response toward members of certain groups you’ve been conditioned to signal you care about. Different people are conditioned to feel this for different groups, of course, but the point I’m trying to make is it’s nowhere close to universally applied, and you probably don’t think it should be. For some people this limited protection probably transmutes into genuine compassion for a group, which is fantastic, but for most I suspect the experience is close to the opposite: not a recognition of a person’s innate, messy humanity, but a surface-level pattern matching against a checklist. If the score is high enough, you speak up against any and all criticism you perceive. If the score is too low, you lob any and all criticism you can think of. These days I don’t see very many neutral responses.

The most straightforward way for someone to lose almost all their points against your checklist? Identify with TheOtherParty. There’s no room for nuance, no recognition of the universal truth that everyone is flawed, that everyone deserves your compassion and your best effort to understand what makes them say what they say and do what they do. “Oh, come on, they’re clearly just X.” Nope, try again. Are you clearly just ~X? No? What makes you different? “But they’re acting in bad faith!” Can you tell if they *know* they’re acting in bad faith, or if they’re on autopilot? Have you ever been unaware you’re acting in bad faith? Would it change your reaction if you knew they weren’t aware of what they were doing?

One way I can tell how empathetic I’m being in the middle of a conversation is based off my level of curiosity about the other person. If I want to ask questions, if I’m wondering about their past or what they value most, that’s a good sign that I’m being open to taking their perspective and feeling what they feel. If I find myself preparing my next response while they’re talking, or if I’m looking for an opportunity to correct them or point out a fallacy/contradiction, chances are if I inspect my own emotional state, I’ll find that I’m negatively aroused: my mind is treating this as a conflict, not a cooperation. Conflict does exist, and I’m not saying you should naively try to understand what someone’s childhood was like as they tie a noose around your neck, but we are *so* quick to assume the person we’re talking to/about is out to get us, we almost never give them an honest chance to show us who they are. Part of this suspicion has to be baked into our DNA. The apes who were charitable and taken advantage of repeatedly were probably more likely to starve before passing on their genes. But part of this behavior is learned — I know, because I’ve been unlearning it for years — and I think we’re learning the wrong lessons at an alarming rate.

Consider this example. Over the past several decades, protecting minority groups — usually based off immutable characteristics, but also including certain religions, for example — has become increasingly virtuous in US culture (broadly speaking). To a certain extent, this is a Very Good Thing, and I don’t think I need to convince you of that. However, in recent years this pendulum has continued its swing into dogma. I can understand how we got here: the paradox of intolerance holds that any society which permits all speech and action will inevitably be taken over by the intolerant. The only defense, which is now cliche, is “we must not tolerate intolerance.” Okay, I’m with you, but what do you mean by intolerance? At one point intolerance meant pervasive discrimination, hate crimes, or straight up lynching; calling people slurs or openly saying that women should “know their place” was just “boys being boys,” not a sign of hatred in your heart. But over time, in our attempt to protect the downtrodden, the definition of intolerance has shifted. It seems it has broadened so much as to include voting for candidates, making comments about media or current events, or even simply sharing one’s personal experience. (If you need help being charitable toward me right now, I don’t mean comments like “they should just keep to their own kind.” Actually, eventually I *would* include even those comments, but we need to start on Easy before trying to FC Through the Fire and Flames on Expert.)

Defending the weak and giving a voice to the voiceless are honorable goals, but what happens when your defense is so effective, it effectively shuts down conversation? I’ve seen enough to say: it forces both bigotry and good-faith disagreement alike under the surface, and it robs us collectively of the ability to have difficult conversations and remain empathetic. In other words, this reflexive defense against intolerance has socialized us into fragility. We’re so sensitive to hatred (good!) that it takes the mildest tap to shatter us (not good…) Others have covered this phenemenon much better than I can, so I’ll keep this brief. Settings which used to be known for their challenging and stimulating atmosphere, like college campuses, are now full of students who have been conditioned to either parrot the Accepted Party Line, or better, avoid certain areas of thought entirely. The workplace is sterilized of political talk, except if you’re going to parrot the Accepted Party Line; to ban that would be intolerant! Social media is the perfect setup for dogpiles, where the only safe thing to say is the Accepted Party Line. Anything else will get you blocked, reported, and screamed at. Oh, and the Accepted Party Line changes pretty often, so in all these settings, you better be careful about what you said in the past, too.

I’ve also noticed the gap between “I personally think this is wrong” and “this shouldn’t be permitted, full stop” has shrunk dramatically in recent years. I’m not sure whether this is a cause or an effect of the preceding. At the extremes, yes, the distinction is meaningless. But that’s the whole point; everything feels extreme now. It has become so difficult, seemingly impossible, to think both 1) wow, my neighbor’s/friend’s/father’s/fellow internet surfer’s opinion on this is terrible and 2) everyone’s entitled to their opinion. We’ve run into what feels like the paradox of the paradox of intolerance: in order to protect society from the intolerant, we must *become* the intolerant. But less like Batman, and more, like, feels bad, man.

So, what to do? How do you get us out of this mess? Yes, it has to be you. Even if it was only you. That’s your duty. The good news is it’s my duty too, so I’ll be there too, and a few others. There are dozens of us! Dozens!! And hopefully one day, many more.

**Step 1:** *Practice*. Practice more empathy. Learn to listen to and understand what you’re hearing. If you can admit you don’t understand, ask questions. If you can admit you disagree, say so in a kind way that invites more discussion, not convinces someone to give up and shut up. The more you learn, the more you’ll realize how much you share in common, and (most of the time), the disagreement doesn’t matter as much as you thought it did.

**Step 2:** No, that’s really it. Go read step 1 again. It’s a lot to do differently, and I know you; we’re not so different, you and I. You’ll do best trying to improve in just this one (big) thing. And I think you’ll be surprised by how much you can change, both in how you see the world, and how the world sees you.

I suppose the only other thing I’ll say is developing and practicing empathy is probably going to hurt you, like it hurts me. You’re going to feel lonely. You’re going to frustrate your friends and family, who are used to dunking on others with your tacit (or explicit) support, and you might piss off people who don’t know you well enough to give you the benefit of the doubt. You’re going to confuse people, and you’re going to be accused of holding the despicable perspectives of people that you empathize with. But you’re also going to learn more about others and yourself. You’re going to break the cycles of reactionary suffering, slowly but surely. You’re going to set an example of a different way. A better way.

Building bridges takes a lot of work, but it’s worth it. It has to be, if we’re going to live together. So take care, and be kind.
